## Causal Segmentation Analysis with `sherlock`

The `sherlock` R package implements an approach for population segmentation
analysis (or subgroup discovery) using recently developed techniques from causal
machine learning. Using data from randomized A/B experiments or observational
studies (quasi-experiments), `sherlock` takes as input a set of user-selected
candidate segment dimensions -- often, a subset of measured pre-treatment
covariates -- to discover particular segments of the study population based on
the estimated heterogeneity of their response to the treatment under
consideration. In order to quantify this treatment response heterogeneity, the
_conditional average treatment effect_ (CATE) is estimated using a
nonparametric, doubly robust framework [@vanderweele19; @vdL15; @Luedtke16a;
@Luedtke16b], incorporating state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning
[@vdl2007super; @coyle2021sl3] in the estimation procedure.

For background and details on using `sherlock`, see the package vignette.  For
an overview of the statistical methodology, see our [conference
manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01223) [@hejazi2021framework] from [CODE
@ MIT
2021](https://ide.mit.edu/events/2021-conference-on-digital-experimentation-mit-codemit/).

## Installation

Install the _most recent version_ from the `master` branch on GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Netflix/sherlock")
```

<!--
Eventually, the package will make its way to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).
At that point, a stable version may be installed via

```{r cran-stable-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sherlock")
```
-->
